<h1>Pitch</h1>
Current we would like to develop an app for restaurants and consumers.  the problem this app is attempting to solve is eliminating the inconvenience of not being able to travel to a larger range of restaurants either because of tight schedules or the restaurantâ€™s location and other unforeseen factors that could range from but not limited to time, long waits, schedule constraints and to allow you to have more time for import task. 
App functionality
The completed app will allow users to place an order for a delivery or pick-up order. Then ether choose between picking up/delivery asap or schedule a time later. It will allow users to choose from a list of supported restaurants then choose items then pay,
